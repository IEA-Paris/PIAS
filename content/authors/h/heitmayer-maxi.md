Maxi Heitmayer is a Social Psychologist working on the situated use of technologies and especially smartphones. His research is based on the use of digital video ethnography techniques (SEBE) to study how users interact with their devices in naturally occurring contexts, which routines and behavioural patterns they have developed, and how this influences their decision-making processes, particularly regarding the use of time and the direction of attention. He is currently a Teaching Fellow for the MSc Psychology of Economic Life at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
