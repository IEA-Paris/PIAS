Gerit Pfuhl  is Associate Professor in Cognitive Sciences at UiT, The Arctic University of Norway. She received a grant from the Norwegian research council to investigate aberrant decision making along the autism-psychosis continuum. That is, her research interest is in (ir)rationality and decision-making under uncertainty. In her lab a variety of methods are used to decipher how we decide, including comparative studies and pupillometry. She fully supports the open science movement, being a member of the psychological science accelerator (PSA), collective replication and education project (CREP), and the Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence project (SCORE).
