            Robert Zatorre is a cognitive neuroscientist who is an expert in
            auditory cognition, focusing on human understanding of speech and
            music. He has worked on many, if not all, aspects of human auditory
            processing using modern brain-imaging techniques like functional and
            structural MRI, MEG and EEG, and brain stimulation techniques,
            together with cognitive and psychophysical measures. Professor at
            McGill University, he is co-founder of the international laboratory
            for Brain, Music, and Sound research (BRAMS). Among other
            prestigious awards that he has earned, he was awarded the C.L. de
            Carvalho-Heineken Prize in Cognitive Sciences in 2020.
