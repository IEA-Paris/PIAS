Bennett Kleinberg is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Tilburg University and an Honorary Associate Professor at the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London. His research interests are between the behavioural (and social) sciences and natural language processing. Some projects are right at the intersection, others lean more to either area.
