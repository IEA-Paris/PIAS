## Covid#Migrants

The project’s objective is to study if (and how) the Covid-19 context affects Twitter contents in relation to #migrants./The project’s objective is to study if (and how) the Covid-19 context affects Twitter contents in relation to migrants in France. It is based on a dataset of 7,586 tweets comprising the hashtag #migrants, collected during two periods: (i) from President Macron’s announcement of the closure of all education institutions on March 12th, 2020 – the country’s first national lockdown being implemented a few days later, on March 17th – until the beginning of deconfinement on May 11th, 2020, i.e. 60 days; (ii) from October 30th to December 15th, 2020 (2nd national lockdown), i.e. 48 days. It takes an interest in the way the topic of the coronavirus has slotted into Twitter discussions on migrants. The project uses content analysis (qualitative and quantitative approaches). The project Covid#Migrants draws upon and extends findings of the project “M-Phasis Migration and Patterns of Hate Speech in Social Media. A Cross-cultural Perspective”, funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France), DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany. Covid#Migrants is conducted within the Center for Research on Mediations, an interdisciplinary research unit of 230 researchers at the University of Lorraine, France, mainly positioned in the field of Information-Communication and Language.
