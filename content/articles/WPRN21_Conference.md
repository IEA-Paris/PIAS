At a time when the world is facing a major health challenge, the Natural and Life Sciences are mobilized to find vaccines and remedies. At the same time, the Social Sciences and Humanities have moved to the forefront to help our societies face the lockdown and the wave of socio-economic crisis that follows. This mobilization, because it is unprecedented, needs new resources to coordinate, and new formats to build reflexivity to learn from our successes and our mistakes in view of the next crises. The World Pandemic Research Network (WPRN) contributes to meeting these needs through its platform wprn.org.

WPRN offers an infrastructure serving research communities based on both crowdsourcing and the mobilization of distributed referent expertise. It documents in real time what is being done in the world. It allows everyone to record their resources (research projects, calls for proposals, surveys, seminars, etc.), and to know who is doing what and where, and to get in touch with the relevant projects.

WPRN differs from other initiatives by the priority given to the human and social sciences, the robustness of its infrastructure anchored in the cloud and because it mobilizes an international and interdisciplinary network of «referents» who sort the projects, providing a first level of scientific edition.WPRN allows the sharing of data, questionnaires, and hypotheses in real time while maintaining the intellectual property (authorship) system of tracking and accountability. WPRN creates the conditions for accelerating «good» research and the emergence of new collaborative research formats.

Initiated by the Paris Institute for Advanced Study and the RFIEA Foundation, WPRN is a non-profit research organisation. It has received support from the International Academic Union, which federates some 100 Academies in the humanities and social sciences in more than 60 countries, the European and global networks of Institutes of Advanced Studies NETIAS and UBIAS, the European Alliance for Social Sciences and Humanities (EASSH), the International Panel for Social Progress (IPSP) and the International Science Council (ISC).

WPRN also benefited form the generous support of the French ministry for Higher Education, Research and Innovation.

With over 1,000 registered research projects and initiatives, the online platform of the World Pandemic Research Network is the first tool enabling the community working on the on the human, economic, and societal impacts of Covid-19 to showcase, access and discuss projects.

## WPRN 21 Conference in Paris

\#WPRN21 conference goes one step further to encourage collective intelligence and foster interactivity. It is the first international forum bringing together researchers and practitioners from all areas of expertise and backgrounds working on the impacts of Covid-19, giving them the opportunity to present ongoing projects, share and disseminate insights and results, and to make connections for future collaboration.

During the December 9-10 WPRN conference, experts from all over the globe shared their insights and lessons learned from the pandemic in 9 Keynote presentations, as well as 6 topic panels comprising 39 research papers. The Keynote speakers tackled the following topics :

- _Economic epidemiology put to the test of the Covid-19 crisis: some emerging ideas and approaches_, Raouf Boucekkine (Rennes School of Business, Aix-Marseille School of Economics)
- _The impact of COVID on SMEs in China based on multiple rounds of surveys before and after the shock,_ Xiaobo Zhang (International Food Policy Research Institute)
- _COVID‑19 and the value of safe transport in the United States,_ Ted Loch-Temzelides (Rice University and The Baker Institute, Houston)
- _Optimal combination of epidemic control policies: lessons from an expanded epidemic-economic model_, Andy Dobson (Princeton University)
- _Social Cohesion, Inequality, and the Pandemic: Lessons from Brazil_, Elisa Reis (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro)
- _Trading off lives and livelihoods in an ethical way, considering the apparent clash of interests between generations,_ Marc Fleurbaey (Paris School of Economics)
- _Emotional responses to the pandemic through the lens of text data,_ Bennett Kleinberg (Tilburg University, University College London)
- _In Science We Should Trust (controlling for the Social Desirability Bias),_ Enrique Fatas & Paulius Yamin (Center for Social Norms and Behavioural Dynamics, University of Pennsylvania)
- _Moving the discussion forward - lessons learned and next steps_, Helga Nowotny (ETH Zurich), Saadi Lahlou (Paris Institute of Advanced Studies, London School of Economics and Political Science), Olivier Bouin (Network for French Institutes of Advanced Study, European Alliance for SSH)

The paper panels focused on 6 research hotspots:

- _News & Media Coverage_
- _Masks, Vaccinations & Compliance_
- _Economic & Financial Impacts_
- _Education & Marginalised Communities_
- _Local Contexts & Policy_
- _Emotions & Coping during Crisis_

Recordings of all presentations can be found in the [WPRN Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLv_k1nsHewlD-pB7BCWsiQnNvb_NhPpO 'WPRN Playlist'), and the full program is accessible [here](https://wprn.org/conference/ 'WPRN Program').
