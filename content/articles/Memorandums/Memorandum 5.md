## Covid 19 and employment upheavals: worried employees

The Covid 19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread (containment, social distancing) have led to a recession and a major economic crisis. The economic data show significant job losses. The [Insee Emploi-Chômage](https://infodujour.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/note-de-conjoncture-8-setembre-2020.pdf) note published on September 8th notes 715,000 salaried jobs lost in France in the first half of this year. Against this backdrop, employees are deeply concerned about their professional future and therisk of job loss.

Several studies reviewed on WPRN have attempted to capture employees’ concerns about employment and work in such a troubled context. The objective of this note is to shed light on how the economic upheavals linked to this crisis are experienced by employees.

The studies highlight a significant concern among employees regarding the risk of job loss. The impacts on work may also have led employees to feel a loss of meaning with regard to work and to revise their professional priorities.

### Employees express strong concerns about the risk of job loss, job stagnation and wage regression, a fear that is all the more strongly felt when employees belong to a «vulnerable» group

A study by the University of Ghent, available on WPRN conducted at the end of March and based on a representative panel of Belgian employees, highlights the worries related to employment that affect employees. More than one out of five respondents indicate that they are afraid of losing their job as a result of the crisis. And one in seven think they will lose their job by the end of the year. These data are consistent with those expressed by other surveys. In France, in a [survey](https://www.glassdoor.fr/blog/covid-enquete-peur-perte-emploi/) of 1,000 people conducted in April by Censuswide for the Glassdoor recruitment platform, 39% of respondents feared losing their jobs or experiencing a drop in salary. Fear of missing out on career opportunities is also significant. In the Ghent University study, more than one in four respondents expressed concern about missing out on a promotion they would have received had the crisis not occurred. One person in two expresses fear of a pay cut and one in three believes that the pandemic will have a significant impact on their career.

The fear of not finding a job is also significant, with one person in two expressing concern that Covid 19 will have a significant impact on job vacancies. A University of Florida study listed on WPRN highlights this concern in another way. The study assessed unemployment or fear of unemployment in the United States from the Google searches of Internet users. It shows that an increase in the search on the Covid in a state directly leads to an increase in the search for unemployment on the search engine.

The fear of losing one’s job appears to be stronger among the more «vulnerable» groups. The authors of the Ghent University study note concerns about greater job loss among migrant workers and older workers. Unemployed people also see things more negatively. Likewise, the fear of missing a promotion increases significantly among the temporarily unemployed, while it is low among civil servants. People with temporary contracts in the private sector are much more worried about losing income than others. Young people express more fear of feeling less motivated to work.

The differences are also marked in terms of gender. A study from the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom surveyed on WPRN on the gender impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic found among those surveyed that women were twice as likely as men to have been affected by job loss. Women also express more anxiety than men about the impacts of the coronavirus. These stronger effects on women have been confirmed by several studies. Finally, the effects are marked according to occupational sector. Indeed, it is logically in the sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as tourism, that employees express the most anxiety about their future careers. While the coronavirus kills more men than women, its impact on society has served to highlight and even accentuate inequalities that disadvantage women.
