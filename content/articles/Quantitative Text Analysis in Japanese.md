abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the way mediated content about the
  novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak fluctuated in the Japanese information environment
  from January â€“ April 2020. This will be made possible through collecting data and
  making comparisons of the topics that were prevalent in traditional media and social
  media before and after the pandemic declaration by the WHO. As early as February
  2020, the WHO has been labelling this outbreak as a dangerous infodemic therefore
  this study aims at providing analysis results that will concisely present an accurate
  and objective view of the types of topics in traditional and social media. This
  study hopes to also present analysis results that can provide governments with new
  insight on resolving the discontent towards lack of information and suspicion among
  citizens.
