  The Paris Institute for Advanced Study (Paris IAS) is a transdisciplinary research center that welcomes researchers from all over the world in the fields of humanities and social sciences. It is also open to other disciplines, in particular the life sciences, for projects involving the humanities and social sciences, as well as to cross-sectoral research with actors from the administration or the economy, and citizens.

  The research projects carried out at the Institute, beyond their international aspect, are characterized by an interdisciplinary approach and the development of new methodologies and research axes. Projects mixing arts and sciences, transdisciplinary and intersectoral projects (sciences, politics, economy, society) are particularly encouraged.

  Each year, the Institute's residents and partner institutions organize about a hundred colloquia and conferences on its premises, on fundamental research topics or in response to major societal problems.

  These Proceedings of the Paris Institute for Advanced Study (Paris IAS) present the colloquia and conference cycles in the form of selective publications, often accompanied by videos or podcasts of the meetings.
