1. Covid#Migrants : Tweeting on Migrants in the Covid-19 Context

The project’s objective is to study if (and how) the Covid-19 context affects Twitter contents in relation to #migrants./The project’s objective is to study if (and how) the Covid-19 context affects Twitter contents in relation to migrants in France. It is based on a dataset of 7,586 tweets comprising the hashtag #migrants, collected during two periods: (i) from President Macron’s announcement of the closure of all education institutions on March 12th, 2020 – the country’s first national lockdown being implemented a few days later, on March 17th – until the beginning of deconfinement on May 11th, 2020, i.e. 60 days; (ii) from October 30th to December 15th, 2020 (2nd national lockdown), i.e. 48 days. It takes an interest in the way the topic of the coronavirus has slotted into Twitter discussions on migrants. The project uses content analysis (qualitative and quantitative approaches).

1. Informative Contagion : The Coronavirus in Italian journalism

The spreading of new Coronavirus in addition to becoming a global phenomenon, following the declaration of a pandemic state, has generated excessive access to information, phenomenon named “Infodemia” (Cinelli et al., 2020). The general purpose of the exploratory study is to investigate how the coronavirus situation is described from the journalistic communication. Starting from La Repubblica online, as a reference journalistic magazine, the study assumes that if the circulation of information helps to create a social representation of the phenomenon, the excessive accessibility to sources of information (infodemia) can be modulated by the “how” the phenomenon is described by the journalists. The methodology proposed is quanti-qualitative (mixed method). A Content Analysis (Mayring, 2004) with the SketchEngine software (Thomas, 2016) is carried out first. In support, a Diatextual Analysis (Papapicco & Mininni, 2019) was carried out. The results show the presence of the contrast vision about COVID-19 situation in Italy.

1. Topic modelling of COVID-19 Content in Japanese newspaper and Twitter -January to April 2020

The purpose of this study is to examine how content about the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak changed in the Japanese information environment through a comparison of the topics that were prevalent in traditional media and social media. The paper investigated how the topics of information regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in newspapers and Twitter differed, how the topics in relation to COVID-19 of newspapers and Twitter users changed before and after the WHO pandemic declaration, with the assumptions that topics that are relevant to the central government of Japan are more often found in newspapers, rather than Twitter and topics that are relevant to Japanese families and individuals are more often found in Twitter, rather than newspapers. A total of 10953 newspaper articles and 171,996 tweets before and after the pandemic declaration by the WHO.

1. The Demography of Covid-19 Deaths Database

Since the start of the pandemic, statistical offices in many countries have been publishing daily estimates of COVID-19 deaths. This project collects material from national reports and databases presenting these numbers and publishes it in a freely accessible and duly documented international database on COVID-19 mortality. The aim is to provide researchers and non-specialists with tools to rigorously assess the accuracy of COVID-19 death counts for international comparisons of the pandemic.
