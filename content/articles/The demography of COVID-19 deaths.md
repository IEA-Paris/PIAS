AN OPEN ACCESS PLATFORM TO INTERNATIONAL DATA AND METADATA ON COVID-19 DEATHS

AIM. Since the start of the pandemic, statistical offices in many countries have been publishing daily estimates of COVID-19 deaths. This project collects material from national reports and databases presenting these numbers and publishes it in a freely accessible and duly documented international database on COVID-19 mortality. The aim is to provide researchers and non-specialists with tools to rigorously assess the accuracy of COVID-19 death counts for international comparisons of the pandemic.

CONTENT/METHOD. The database comprises (1) COVID-19 death counts stratified by sex, age group and place of death, and (2) information describing the data coverage, quality and accuracy. This bilingual French-English platform also provides information on key issues about the limitations of COVID-19 data for analyses of mortality dynamics. So far data, metadata and the associated documentation (e.g., national reports, methodological documents) have been published for the following 21 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and United States of America. Data will be periodically updated (weekly at the moment) until the end of the pandemic.
