### Session 4 Prophets and Profecies in Historical Perspective

This final session will attempt to compare current prophetic dynamics with prophetic movements well known to historians of religion. This comparison seems warranted given that some words conventionally used in religious life and history (belief, heresy, vocation, scriptures, priests, apocalypse, millenarianism) allow to precisely describe the controversies surrounding the prophetic speech and its reception in the public debate. This session will provide opportunity to reflect on the idea that runs through classical and recent research that a set of forms, traits and patterns inherited from religion continues to permeate social life. Additionally, we will ponder whether religious analogies help better describe and critically analyse the current prophetic phenomena in the financial, environmental and health domains.

The expected impact of this symposium is twofold. First, this event aims to forge relationships between researchers who share common research problems but who rarely meet due to lack of transdisciplinary forums dedicated to the study of prophecy. The objective here is to build a network of researchers working on prophets and prophecies in different domains and time periods and from multiple disciplinary standpoints and traditions. Second, this event will facilitate the diffusion of social science research in the public debate where the prophetic speech arouses intense controversy. This event will allow to put into analytical and historical perspective the current prophetic phenomena which can become hard to read or interpret when studied in isolation or through research carried out hastily in emergency contexts.
