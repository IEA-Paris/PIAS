**Panel recommendations (draft, to be edited)**

The PFUE conference on SSH Research Evaluation has gathered representatives of SSH associations, stakeholders and scholars on May 16th-17th, 2022. Considering the pressing need for change in SSH research evaluation and integration, the participants offer nine recommendations, based on years of experience in researching SSH epistemic frameworks for knowledge production and in conducting SSH research evaluation at all levels.

These recommendations concern the three main areas of the conference, namely research outcomes diversity, multilingualism and SSH integration, in the light of SSH evaluation.

They are addressed and adapted to decision makers, funding and evaluating agencies and bodies, and –last but not least– SSH scholars themselves via scholarly bodies and associations.

1\. **Ensure inclusion of various research outcomes** (underlining diversity of academic, professional and dissemination outputs in open access, no matter the language)

2\. **Support digital infrastructure advancement** (ensuring discoverability, accessibility and legibility of relevant data and material published on a specific topic, no matter the language)

3\. **Mechanisms of the decisions on academic publications should be transparent and based on publicly accepted peer review standards** (prestige of publishers and collections should not be considered)

4\. **Assessment criteria should be attentive to (multi)disciplinary cultures and contexts**

5\. **Some experts in the ex-ante evaluation of proposals should be involved in ex-post evaluation of outcomes**

6\. Need to have two types of board to assess programs and projects in Pillar II: one **Scientific Advisory Board** (including SSH scholars) **and one Societal Advisory Board** (with civil society stakeholders)

7\. **Support new pan-European surveys on societal issues to incentivize multi/interdisciplinary research** (in relation to missions/clusters and open to bottom-up proposals)

8\. **Increase technical support staff to access data and infrastructures as well as scientific facilitators to develop multidisciplinary work**

9\. **Increase the awareness of scholars and experts of infrastructures** to improve research and assessment
