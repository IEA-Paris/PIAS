1. The Economic and Financial Repercussions of COVID-19

The project uses a broad range of methods and data worldwide to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall economy and the financial sector.

The analysis can be subdivided in: * Using long time series, we analyze the long-term effects of the pandemic on unemployment and economic growth for several countries. We find that unemployment and growth could take a long time to return to normal levels in the absence of policies tailored to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. * Using large cross-sectional data, we isolate some of the variables that help explain the heterogeneous effect of the pandemic between countries. We find that trust in the government and the medical personnel is a significant factor to reduce the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. * In the financial sector, we find that uncertainty has become more persistent after the start of the pandemic. We show that these changes in the degrees of memory are statistically significant using a test for change in persistence. * We analyze the effect of the pandemic on pollution levels and mobility. We find no evidence to support the carrier hypothesis. That is, the air pollution-to-human transmission channel is not significant.
